TDAG2016	Understanding The Mechanism Of TDAG51's Poly-PQ Domain On Apoptosis	projects/tdag2016.png	<b>Figure:</b> The PQ region of TDAG51 causes morphological changes in a cell depending on localization. When PQ is present in the cytoplasm (top), it has minimal effect on the total cytosolic area and morphology over 48 hours. However, when PQ is localized into the nucleus (bottom), the cytosol of the cell shrinks with time until the cell eventually under go apoptosis.	Research Assistant (CO-OP)	May 2016 - Dec 2016	Austin Lab, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON	Responsible for studying the effect of TDAG51's Poly-PQ domain on apoptosis using plasmid transfection and quantification techniques like LDH release assay, TUNEL assays and Annexin V staining in order to understand TDAG51's prominent role in diabetes and atherosclerosis.; Attempted to elucidate the mechanism of action of the small molecule 4'-phenylbutyrate's ER stress relieving capabilities in peripheral macrophages using western blot techniques for the potential therapeutic application of the compound in atherosclerosis and cardiac diseases.

CARD2015	Advancing Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance with the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)	projects/card2015.png	<b>Figure:</b> The output of the RGI analysis of a clinically relevant bacterial genome showing the classification and name of resistance genes it contains ordered by how similar they are to known resistance genes	Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) BioCurator (CO-OP)	Jan 2015 - Sept 2015	McArthur Lab, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON	Maintained and Updated the <a href=https://card.mcmaster.ca target=_blank>CARD</a>, resulting in one of the most robustly curated database with over 3,000 known resistance genes, gene targets and antibiotics.;Conducted an extensive literature review to overhaul the CARD's mutation data to construct prediction models for identifying antibiotic resistance driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms.;Designed and created the new CARD database schema, termed ‘Broad Street', using PostgreSQL resulting in a database 1/5th of the original size and allowing the addition of new prediction models for available data, making it future-proof.;Collaborated with a team of two software developers, created the Resistance Gene Identifier Ver. 3, an upgrade of the bioinformatics tool that uses CARD's data to predict resistance profiles of a given bacteria (Shown in above picture). The upgrade allowed for separation of software from the database allowing for independent software development and resistance data curation.;Worked with a web developer on creating a new CARD website that is simpler and more user-friendly as well as containing a variety of web based curator tools for better version control and removing the need for Linux command line interactions for future biocurators.
